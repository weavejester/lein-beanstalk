# lein-beanstalk

Leiningen plugin for Amazon's [Elastic Beanstalk][1]

## Prerequisites

You will need an [Amazon Web Services][2] account, and know your
account key and secret key.

You will also need to be signed up for Elastic Beanstalk.

## Basic Configuration

To use lein-beanstalk, you'll need to add a few additional values to
your `project.clj` file.

First, add lein-beanstalk as a development dependency:

    :dev-dependencies [[lein-beanstalk "0.2.0"]]

Then add a `lein-beanstalk-credentials` definition to your
`~/.lein/init.clj` file that contains your AWS credentials:

    (def lein-beanstalk-credentials
      {:access-key "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
       :secret-key "YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY"})

### Deploy

You should now be able to deploy your application to the Amazon cloud
using the following command:

    $ lein beanstalk deploy development

### Info

To get information about the application itself run

    $ lein beanstalk info
    Application Name : myapp
    Description      : My Awesome Compojure App
    Last 5 Versions  : 0.1.0-20110209030504

and information about a particular environment execute

    $ lein beanstalk info development
    Environment Id   : e-lm32mpkr6t
    Application Name : myapp
    Environment Name : development
    Description      : Default environment for the myapp application.

### Shutdown

To shutdown an existing environment use the following command

    $ lein beanstalk terminate development

This terminates the environment and all of its resources, i.e.
the Auto Scaling group, LoadBalancer, etc.

### Cleanup

To remove any unused versions from the S3 bucket run

    $ lein beanstalk clean


##  Configuration

### AWS Credentials

The [Amazon Web Services][2] account key and secret key should be
put into a `lein-beanstalk-credentials` definition in your
`~/.lein/init.clj` file:

    (def lein-beanstalk-credentials
      {:access-key "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
       :secret-key "YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY"})

Keeping your credentials out of your `project.clj` file and out
of your project in general helps ensure you don't accidentally
commit your credentials to github et al.

### Environments

Elastic Beanstalk environments can be defined in multiple ways in
the `project.clj` file.

If no environments are specified, lein-beanstalk will create three
default environments

* `development` (with CNAME prefix `myapp-development`)
* `staging` (with CNAME prefix `myapp-staging`)
* `production` (with CNAME prefix `myapp`)

To override the default behavior, add an `:aws` key to your
`project.clj` file, either with `:environments` mapped to a
vector of envionment symbols:

    :aws {:beanstalk {:environments [dev demo prod]
                      ...}
          ...}

or to a vector of maps

    :aws {:beanstalk {:environments [{:name "dev"}
                                     {:name "demo"}
                                     {:name "prod"}]
                      ...}
          ...}

Given either of the above configurations, the following two
environents will be created:

* `dev` (with CNAME prefix `myapp-dev`)
* `demo` (with CNAME prefix `myapp-demo`)
* `prod` (with CNAME prefix `myapp-prod`)

The second option allows one to specify the CNAME prefix for each
environment

    :aws {:beanstalk {:environments [{:name "dev"
                                      :canme-prefix "myapp-development"}
                                     {:name "staging"
                                      :cname-prefix "myapp-demo"}
                                     {:name "prod"
                                      :canme-prefix "myapp"}]
                      ...}
          ...}

By default the CNAME prefix is `<project-name>-<environment>`.


### S3 Buckets

[Amazon Elastic Beanstalk][1] uses
[Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)][3] to store the versions
of the application. By default lein-beanstalk uses
`lein-beanstalk.<project-name>` as the S3 bucket name.

To use a custom bucket, specify it in the `project.clj` file:

    :aws {:beanstalk {:s3-bucket "my-private-bucket"
                      ...}}


## Trouble-Shooting

Q: Why does my deployed web application still shows up as 'red' in the
Elastic Beanstalk console?

A: Elastic Beanstalk sends a HTTP `HEAD` request to '/' to check if
the application is running. Simply add the necessary handling to the
application. e.g. for Compojure add

    (HEAD "/" [] "")

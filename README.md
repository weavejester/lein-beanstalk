# lein-beanstalk

Leiningen plugin for Amazon's [Elastic Beanstalk][1].

## Prerequisites

You will need an [Amazon Web Services][2] account, and know your
account key and secret key.

You will also need to be signed up for Elastic Beanstalk.

## Basic Configuration

To use lein-beanstalk, you'll need to add a few additional values to
your `project.clj` file.

First, add lein-beanstalk as a plugin:
```clojure
:plugins [[lein-beanstalk "0.2.7"]]
```

or, if you're using a version of Leiningen prior to 1.7.0, add it to
your `:dev-dependencies`:
```clojure
:dev-dependencies [[lein-beanstalk "0.2.7"]]
```
Then add a `lein-beanstalk-credentials` definition to your
`~/.lein/init.clj` file that contains your AWS credentials:
```clojure
(def lein-beanstalk-credentials
  {:access-key "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
   :secret-key "YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY"})
```

Or, if you're using Leiningen 2, you can add the credentials to your
`~/.lein/profile.clj` file:
```clojure
{:user
 {:aws {:access-key "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
        :secret-key "YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY"}}}
```
Finally, lein-beanstalk uses lein-ring for packaging your
application, so all of lein-ring's configuration applies as well.
At a minimum, you'll need to your `project.clj` a reference to
your application's top-level handler, e.g.:

```clojure
:ring {:handler hello-world.core/handler}
```

See the documentation for [lein-ring](https://github.com/weavejester/lein-ring)
for more about the options it provides.

### Deploy

You should now be able to deploy your application to the Amazon cloud
using the following command:

    $ lein beanstalk deploy development

### Info

To get information about the application itself run

    $ lein beanstalk info
    Application Name : myapp
    Description      : My Awesome Compojure App
    Last 5 Versions  : 0.1.0-20110209030504

### Shutdown

To shutdown an existing environment use the following command

    $ lein beanstalk terminate development

This terminates the environment and all of its resources, i.e.
the Auto Scaling group, LoadBalancer, etc.

### Cleanup

To remove any unused versions from the S3 bucket run

    $ lein beanstalk clean


##  Configuration

### AWS Credentials

The [Amazon Web Services][2] account key and secret key should be
put into a `lein-beanstalk-credentials` definition in your
`~/.lein/init.clj` file:
```clojure
(def lein-beanstalk-credentials
  {:access-key "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
   :secret-key "YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY"})
```

Keeping your credentials out of your `project.clj` file and out
of your project in general helps ensure you don't accidentally
commit your credentials to github et al.

However, If you want to deploy your application using beanstalk from
an environment like Jenkins, where you don't have control over the
user, you can export the credential to the environment from the build
script, and inside your `project.clj`, do:
```clojure
(defproject my-project "0.1.0"
    :description ...
    :aws {
        :access-key ~(System/getenv "AWS_ACCESS_KEY")
        :secret-key ~(System/getenv "AWS_SECRET_KEY")})
```
### Environments

Elastic Beanstalk environments can be defined in multiple ways in
the `project.clj` file.

If no environments are specified, lein-beanstalk will create three
default environments

* `development` (with CNAME prefix `myapp-development`)
* `staging` (with CNAME prefix `myapp-staging`)
* `production` (with CNAME prefix `myapp`)

To override the default behavior, add an `:aws` key to your
`project.clj` file, either with `:environments` mapped to a
vector of envionment symbols:
```clojure
:aws {:beanstalk {:environments [dev demo prod]
                  ...}
      ...}
```

or to a vector of maps
```clojure
:aws {:beanstalk {:environments [{:name "dev"}
                                 {:name "demo"}
                                 {:name "prod"}]
                  ...}
      ...}
```
Given either of the above configurations, the following two
environents will be created:

* `dev` (with CNAME prefix `myapp-dev`)
* `demo` (with CNAME prefix `myapp-demo`)
* `prod` (with CNAME prefix `myapp-prod`)

The second option allows one to specify the CNAME prefix for each
environment
```clojure
:aws {:beanstalk {:environments [{:name "dev"
                                  :cname-prefix "myapp-development"}
                                 {:name "staging"
                                  :cname-prefix "myapp-demo"}
                                 {:name "prod"
                                  :canme-prefix "myapp"}]
                  ...}
      ...}
```
By default the CNAME prefix is `<project-name>-<environment>`.

### Environment Variables

You can specify environment variables that will be added to the system
properties of the running application, per beanstalk environment:
```clojure
:aws
{:beanstalk
 {:environments
  [{:name "dev"
    :cname-prefix "myapp-dev"
    :env {"DATABASE_URL" "mysql://..."}}]}}
```

If the environment variable name is a keyword, it is upper-cased and
underscores ("_") are substituted for dashes ("-"). e.g.
`:database-url` becomes `"DATABASE_URL"`.

### S3 Buckets

[Amazon Elastic Beanstalk][1] uses
[Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)][3] to store the versions
of the application. By default lein-beanstalk uses
`lein-beanstalk.<project-name>` as the S3 bucket name.

To use a custom bucket, specify it in the `project.clj` file:
```clojure
:aws {:beanstalk {:s3-bucket "my-private-bucket"
                  ...}}
```
### Regions

You can specify the AWS region of to deploy the application to through
your `project.clj` file:
```clojure
:aws {:beanstalk {:region "eu-west-1"}}
```

The following regions are recognized:

* `us-east-1` (default)
* `ap-northeast-1`
* `eu-west-1`
* `us-west-1`
* `us-west-2`

### Proxy

You can specify the proxy server to use for deployment
your `project.clj` file:
```clojure
:aws {:beanstalk {:proxy-host "proxy.host"
                  :proxy-port 1080}}
```

## Trouble-Shooting

Q: Why does my deployed web application still shows up as 'red' in the
Elastic Beanstalk console?

A: Elastic Beanstalk sends a HTTP `HEAD` request to '/' to check if
the application is running. Simply add the necessary handling to the
application. e.g. for Compojure add
```clojure
(HEAD "/" [] "")
```
